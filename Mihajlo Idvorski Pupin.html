        <p> <b> Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12
                March
                1935)</b>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.
            <br><br>
            Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
            long-distance
            telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
            wire
            (known as "pupinization").
            <br><br>
            Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which
            later
            became NASA. </p>
